# Filter User Data Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## [Live Demo Click Here](https://simple-dictionary-project.netlify.app/).

This project was build with React JS, and it is fetching data from the [Json Placeholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). I used Axios to fetch the data.

### Technologies used: React JS, Bootstrap, Axios.

To see only the data that matches a specific Name, you can use the search bar. Simply type the Name you are looking for in the search bar and press Enter. The data will be filtered to show only the rows that contain that Name. To clear the filter, delete the text from the search bar.
